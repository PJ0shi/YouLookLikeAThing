      <h1>You Look Like A Thing And I Love You</h1>
      <p class="title-subheading">"You Look Like a Thing and I Love You" is this awesome book by Janelle Shane that's all about artificial intelligence (AI) - you know, the stuff that powers things like Siri and self-driving cars. It's funny and approachable, with tons of examples of AI doing silly, unexpected things. At the same time, though, it doesn't shy away from the big questions about how AI is changing our world and what we should be doing to make sure it's used ethically. Even if you're not a tech expert, this book is a great way to learn more about AI and start thinking critically about it.</p>

            faces. Unlike the dataset of human pictures, which was made up of human
            faces seen from the front, the dataset of cat pictures included cats
            photographed from various angles, walking or curled up or meowing at the

    <h3>Giraffing: Why does it happen?</h3>
  <div class="fifty">
    <p class="display-small">
        The reason for this has to do with the data the AI is trained on. Though
        giraffes are uncommon, people are much more likely to photograph a
        giraffe (“Hey, cool, a giraffe!”) than a random boring bit of landscape. The big free-to-use image datasets that so many AI researchers train their
        algorithms on tend to have images of lots of different animals, but few, if
        any, pictures of plain dirt or plain trees. An AI that studies this dataset will
        learn that giraffes are more common than empty fields and will adjust its
        predictions accordingly.

        It’s really tricky to come up with a goal that the AI isn’t going to

        is easier than what you want it to do.

        They don’t have
        common sense, and they don’t know when to ask for clarification. Give
        them a goal—data to imitate or a reward function to maximize (such as
        distance traveled or points collected in a video game)—and they’ll do it,

              thought this would incentivize the algorithm to keep the pancake in

          games. When playing Tetris, it would place the blocks seemingly at
          random, letting them pile up nearly to the top of the screen. The algorithm
          would then realize that it would lose as soon as the next block appeared,
          and so it… paused the game forever. In fact, “pause the game so a bad thing won’t happen,” “stay at the very
          beginning of the level, where it’s safe,” or even “die at the end of level 1 so
          level 2 doesn’t kill you” are all strategies that machine learning algorithms
          will use if you let them.</p>

        learn to move through a video-game level so it can see new stuff, avoiding
        fireballs, monsters, and death pits because when it gets hit by those, it sees
        the same boring death sequence. It isn’t specifically told to avoid dying—as

        <p>Task: Train simulated robots to jump</p>
        <p>Solution 1: To give the robots a value to maximize, they defined their jumping
          height as the maximum height attained by the robot’s center of gravity</p>
          <p>Workaround 1:rather than learn to jump, some of the robots became very tall and simply
            stood there, being tall.</p>
            <p>Solution 2: the goal instead was to maximize the height of the part of the body that
              had been the lowest at the start of the simulation.
            Workaround 2: The robots instead learned to cancan. They became compact robots perched
            on the top of a skinny pole. When the simulation started, they would kick
            the pole high up above their heads, reaching a huge height as they fell to the
            ground</p>

        <p>Task: To walk</p>
        <p>Even when they’re given a two-legged body design
          and told that their goal is to walk, their definition of walk can vary.</p>
          <p>Some of the weird ways AI can walk: some of the robots were walking backwards or even
            sideways. One slowly rotated in a circle as it walked (it might enjoy riding
            in that spinning car). Another traveled forward but did so while hopping on
            one leg—the simulation didn’t seem to be detailed enough to penalize
            solutions that might be rather tiring. One arched its back and leaned
            way forward as it ran but maintained its balance by clasping its hands to its
            neck as if it were dramatically clutching pearls. Another ran sideways with
            its arms held high over its head. Another robot traveled rapidly by
            stumbling backwards with its arms flung out, somersaulting, then rolling to
            its feet, only to stumble backwards and somersault again.</p>

          from point A to point B.</p>
        <p>And it turns out that if you tell an AI to go from A to
          B and don’t tell it what to build, And it turns out that if you tell an AI to go from A to
          B and don’t tell it what to build, It assembles itself into a tower and falls over. AIs love to
          fall over. Give them the task of moving at a high average speed, and you
          can bet they’ll do it by falling over if you let them. Sometimes the robots
          even learn to somersault for extra travel distance. Technically, this is an
          excellent solution, though this isn’t what the humans had in mind.</p>
